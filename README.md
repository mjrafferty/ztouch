# Overview

Inspired by the [zsh-users/zsh-apple-touchbar](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-apple-touchbar) plugin. That serves as an excellent proof of concept for this, but I ultimately decided to write my own implementation of it to expand on its features. The core features that this adds to touch bar controls are:

- Recent History Commands
- Directory Stack
- User mappable commands and labels
- Cycling between modes
